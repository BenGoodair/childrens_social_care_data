Children looked after in England including adoption: 2016 to 2017
SFR 50/2017

Overview

This publication provides information about children looked after in England for the year ending 31 March 2017.  The figures are based on data collected annually through the Children Looked After return (also known as SSDA903) which is completed each spring by all local authorities in England.  Further details on which children are included in the data collection can be found in the children looked after return 2016-17 collection guide:
https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/children-looked-after-return-2016-to-2017-guide.

National totals are derived by summing data provided by each LA and then applying rounding and suppression.  The sum of each LA will not necessarily match national totals as a result.

Regional totals are derived by summing data for each LA within that region and then applying rounding and suppression.  The sum of regional totals will not necessarily match the national total as a result.

LA level data are data as returned by each LA and have been suppressed where necessary.

Rounding and suppression: To ensure that no individual can be identified, we use conventions for the rounding and suppression of small numbers.  National and regional totals have been rounded to the nearest 10.

For confidentiality purposes, numbers from one to five inclusive have been suppressed and replaced by a cross (x).  Where any number is shown as zero (0), the original figure submitted was zero (0).  It has been necessary to suppress other figures whenever it would be possible to calculate the value of a suppressed number by means of simple arithmetic.  The rule applied in these circumstances has been to suppress the next smallest data item.  Where data is not available it is reported as ‘..’.

Data usage notes – further information is available in the CLA guide published alongside the release:

1: In order to allow users maximum flexibility to aggregate data to meet their own purposes, LA level data has been shown to the nearest whole number.

2: The LA_order field can be used to display the data in all files to the published regional and local authority order.

3: 2016 Offending data - The 2016 underlying data included children aged 10 and over, whereas in the SFR tables, children were included if they were aged 10 to 17 and there was a small difference between the tables and the underlying data (18 year olds).  In 2017, the underlying data has been amended to only include children aged 10 to 17.

4: SFR50_2017_Missing2017.csv and SFR50_CareLeavers17182017.csv, and the 11 data items ‘CLA_RPC’ in the file SFR50_2017_CLA2017.csv are experimental statistics and users should be cautious interpreting the data.
