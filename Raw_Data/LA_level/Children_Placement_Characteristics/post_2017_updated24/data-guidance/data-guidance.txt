Children looked after in England including adoptions
2023 Reporting year

Description

This document describes the data included in the ‘Children looked after in England including adoptions: 2022 to 2023’ National Statistics release’s underlying data files. This data is released under the terms of the  Open Government License (http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/doc/open-government-licence/) and is intended to meet at least three stars for  Open Data (https://www.gov.uk/government/policies/improving-the-transparency-and-accountability-of-government-and-its-services/supporting-pages/releasing-data-in-open-formats).

The methodology document for this subject should be referenced alongside this release. It provides information on the data sources, their coverage and quality and how the data is produced.

A guide (https://www.gov.uk/guidance/children-looked-after-return-guide-to-submitting-data) for the 2023 data collection provides further information on the data collected.

Coverage

This data is based upon information collected in the SSDA903 (CLA) data collection. It is a child level dataset collected from local authorities in England annually. The data includes information on:

- children looked after on 31 March in each year, including unaccompanied asylum seeking children
- children looked after at any time
- children who started to be looked after
- children who ceased to be looked after
- children looked after who were adopted
- care leavers now aged 17, 18, 19, 20 and 21 years old
- care leavers now aged 22, 23, 24 and 25 years old (from 2023 onwards)
- children who went missing or away from placement without authorisation
- stability (of placements, schools and social workers)

 The longitudinal nature of the collection means historical information can be amended each year, so we update all time series figures published in each release.  Unless otherwise stated, numbers and percentage exclude children looked after under an agreed  series of short term placements.

Users of the data should consider the following:

- for some local authorities, the figures may be impacted by large numbers of unaccompanied asylum-seeking children and their distinctive characteristics
- from April 2019 the three local authorities ‘Dorset’, ‘Bournemouth’ and ‘Poole’ reorganised into  two local authorities ‘Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole’ and ‘Dorset’. As part of this, a small number of children formerly looked after in the Christchurch area of Dorset were transferred to the new authority ‘Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole’
- from April 2021 Northamptonshire split into two local authorities, ‘North Northamptonshire’ and ‘West Northamptonshire’
- For 2023, Barnsley were unable to provide data on outcomes for children looked after on 31 March, care leavers, missing and previous permanence arrangements for children starting to be looked after in time for publication so their data is missing. 2023 data will be provided and published in the 2024 statistical release.
- Information on children who are missing or who are away from their placement without authorisation are published as Official Statistics. Users should refer to the methodology guide when using this data and should be cautious interpreting any figures across years or between local authorities due to differing practices. Hackney did not provide any missing or away without authorisation data in 2021
- Information on the school and social worker stability of children are published as Official Statistics. Users should refer to the methodology guide when using this data.
- Care leaver data is reported in two distinct groups; young people aged 17-21 years old and young people aged 22-25 years old. For care leavers aged 17-21 years old, the local authority has a duty to be in touch and support the young person. For care leavers aged 22-25 years old, the local authority is expected to provide support if the young person choses to contact them and requests support. Users should be cautious when drawing conclusions from the data for 22-25 year olds as the activity/accommodation data is only available for those young people who contacted the LA and requested and received support. For older care leavers, this cohort may be small.

File formats and conventions

Rounding and suppression

National and regional figures have been rounded to the nearest 10.  Local authority figures are unrounded.

Where any number is shown as zero, the original figure submitted was zero.

The following symbols have been used in the release:

- ‘c’ to protect confidentiality. Secondary suppression may have been applied
- ‘z’ for not applicable
- ‘x’ for not available
- ‘k’ used for a value that would round to zero but is not zero, for example where a percentage is <0.5%

For percentages:

- where the numerator or denominator is small then the figure is replaced by ‘c’
- they may not sum to 100% due to rounding
- they are rounded to whole numbers

Also in the release:

- the average duration for adoptions (formerly table E2) are rounded to the nearest month
- the average number of missing or away without authorisation incidents (formerly in table G1) have been rounded to one decimal place.

3. For young people who turned 22, 23, 24 or 25 during the year, data is only reported if the young person requested and received support from the local authority. Information reported is at their last contact with the local authority.  Local authorities are not expected to be in touch and initiate contact with young people over age 21 who have not requested or received support during the reporting period. This data is collected and reported to record the numbers of older care leavers who are accessing their entitlement to support and to better understand their activity and accommodation status.
4. Data was collected for the first time in 2023, and in some cases may be an undercount of the full cohort, particularly for the older care leavers. We suspect the number of 24-year-olds could be undercounted by up to 3% and 25-year-olds could be undercounted by up to 10% (when comparing to the number of 20- and 21-year-old care leavers reported in 2019).

Users should be cautious when drawing conclusions from this data. Accommodation information is only for those young people who contacted the LA and requested and received support and so for older care leavers the cohort may be small.

Footnotes:

1. Numbers have been rounded to the nearest 10. Percentages rounded to the nearest whole number. Figures exclude young people who were looked after under an agreed series of short term placements, those who have died since leaving care, those who have returned home to parents or someone with parental responsibility for a continuous period of at least 6 months and those whose care was transferred to another local authority.
2. Figures for 2023 exclude Barnsley who were unable to provide data in time for publication.
3. For young people who turned 22, 23, 24 or 25 during the year, data is only reported if the young person requested and received support from the local authority. Information reported is at their last contact with the local authority.  Local authorities are not expected to be in touch and initiate contact with young people over age 21 who have not requested or received support during the reporting period. This data is collected and reported to record the numbers of older care leavers who are accessing their entitlement to support and to better understand their activity and accommodation status.
4. Data was collected for the first time in 2023, and in some cases may be an undercount of the full cohort, particularly for the older care leavers. We suspect the number of 24-year-olds could be undercounted by up to 3% and 25-year-olds could be undercounted by up to 10% (when comparing to the number of 20- and 21-year-old care leavers reported in 2019).

2. Accommodation suitable/not suitable figures also exclude young people who have gone abroad, been deported or their residence is not know as in these cases the suitability of the accommodation will be unknown. This means the total of care leavers in this table will be slightly lower than the total in the care leaver accommodation table. Regulation 9(2) of the Care Leavers Regulations defines what is meant by 'Suitable accommodation'. 'No information' includes young people whose accommodation is not known because they have not been in touch with the local authority during the year.
3. Figures for 2023 exclude Barnsley who were unable to provide data in time for publication.
4. For young people who turned 22, 23, 24 or 25 during the year, data is only reported if the young person requested and received support from the local authority.

4. Since 2017 a growing number of local authorities informed the department that they do not record incidents as 'away without authorisation' but instead report all incidents as 'missing' to maintain consistency with local police reporting. We estimate this could mean an overestimate of missing incidents of up to 10% in 2019, 13% in 2020 and 2021, 10% in 2022 and 11% in 2023; suggesting the true figures could be more like 10,800, 11,000, 9,600, 11,100 and 11,500. There is a corresponding estimate of an undercount of away without authorisation incidents of up to 22% in 2019, 29% in 2020, 32% in 2021, 30% in 2022 and 32% in 2023; suggesting the true figures could be more like 4,700, 4,800, 3,800, 3,600 and 3,900.

Footnotes:

1. Numbers have been rounded to the nearest 10.  Percentages have been rounded to the nearest whole number. Historical data may differ from older publications which is mainly due to amendments made by local authorities after the previous publication. Figures include children who have been continuously looked after for at least 12 months as at 31 March and exclude children who were looked after under an agreed series of short term placements.  Age is as at 31 March. Data for 2023 excludes Barnsley LA who were unable to provide outcomes data for 247 children (of all ages) in time for this release.
2. Latest available comparable offending figures from the Ministry of Justice for all children are for 2017 where 1% of all children aged 10-17 years were convicted or subject to youth cautions, or youth conditional cautions during the year.
3. Substance misuse is defined as 'intoxication by (or regular excessive consumption and/or dependence on) psychoactive substances, leading to social, psychological, physical or legal problems'. It includes problematic use of both legal and illegal drugs (including alcohol when used in conjunction with other substances). The term 'drug' is used to refer to any psychotropic substance, including illegal drugs, illicit use of prescription drugs and volatile substances. Young people's drug taking is often inextricably linked with the consumption of alcohol. Therefore the term 'substance' refers to both drugs and alcohol but not tobacco.
4. Immunisations were up to date by end of March. 'Up to date' means the child has had all immunisations that a child of their age should have received, according to the immunisations timetable produced by the Department of Health.
5. 'Teeth checked by dentist' records whether the child has had their teeth checked by a dentist in the year ending 31 March
6. 'Had annual health assessment' records whether the child received their annual health assessment from a doctor or other suitably qualified professional during the year. Both assessments must be carried out for under fives (once in every six months before the child's fifth birthday). For fives and over a single assessment fulfils the requirement.
7. Development assessment information is collected for children aged 4 or younger at 31 March who were looked after continuously for at least 12 months. This measures whether the child's health surveillance or health promotion checks were up to date.
8. Average SDQ scores have been rounded to the nearest one decimal place. An SDQ score is required of all children aged 4-16 on the date of last assessment. Date of assessment is not collected so data in this table is restricted to children aged 5 to 16 years. A higher score indicates more emotional difficulties. 0-13 is considered normal, 14-16 is borderline cause for concern and 17-40 is cause for concern.
9. Figures for 2023 exclude Barnsley who were unable to provide data in time for publication.
