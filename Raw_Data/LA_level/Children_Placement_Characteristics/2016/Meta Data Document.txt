Children looked after in England including adoption: 2015 to 2016
SFR 41/2016

Overview

This publication provides information about children looked after in England for the year ending 31 March 2016.  The figures are based on data collected annually through the Children Looked After return (also known as SSDA903) which is completed each spring by all local authorities in England.  Further details on which children are included in the data collection can be found in the children looked after return 2015-16 collection guide: https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/children-looked-after-return-2015-to-2016-guide.

National totals are derived by summing data provided by each LA and then applying rounding and suppression.  The sum of each LA will not necessarily match national totals as a result.

Regional totals are derived by summing data for each LA within that region and then applying rounding and suppression.  The sum of regional totals will not necessarily match the national total as a result.

LA level data are data as returned by each LA and have been suppressed where necessary.

Rounding and suppression: To ensure that no individual can be identified, we use conventions for the rounding and suppression of very small numbers.  National totals have been rounded to the nearest 100 if they exceed 1,000 and to the nearest 10 otherwise.  Regional totals have been rounded to the nearest 10.

For confidentiality purposes, numbers from one to five inclusive have been suppressed and replaced by a cross (x).  Where any number is shown as zero (0), the original figure submitted was zero (0).  It has been necessary to suppress other figures whenever it would be possible to calculate the value of a suppressed number by means of simple arithmetic.  The rule applied in these circumstances has been to suppress the next smallest data item.

Data usage note: In order to allow users maximum flexibility to aggregate data to meet their own purposes, LA level data has been shown to the nearest whole number.
