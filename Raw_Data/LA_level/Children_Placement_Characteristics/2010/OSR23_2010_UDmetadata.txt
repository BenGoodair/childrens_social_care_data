Children Missing from Home or Care. Local Authority self-evaluation scores of measures to monitor, respond to and address runaway cases
England, Oct 2008 to Jun 2010

This release provides information on the self-evaluation scores given by each Local Authority on measures to monitor and respond to cases of Children Missing from Home or Care. Further information on how the data have been aggregated can be found in the notes on page 15.
In a range from 0 to 3 (low–high), Local Authorities provided a self-evaluation score on each of the following five criteria.The extent to which:
•	local information about running away is gathered
•	local needs analysis is in place (based on the information gathered)
•	local procedures to meet the needs of runaways agreed
•	protocols for responding to urgent/out of hours referrals from police or other agencies are in place
•	local procedures include effective needs assessment protocols to support effective prevention/intervention work.
A Local Authority overall score is calculated by summing the scores from each of these five criteria, giving a minimum of 0 and a maximum of 15. The England level national indicator is found by taking the average of the Local Authority overall scores.

Since set three (April 2009) the self-evaluation scores were provided by the newly established Local Authorities of Cheshire West and Chester, and Cheshire East as well as Bedford and Central Bedfordshire, which used to be single authorities under the names of Cheshire and Bedfordshire respectively. 

National and GOR averages are derived from the LA scores.
