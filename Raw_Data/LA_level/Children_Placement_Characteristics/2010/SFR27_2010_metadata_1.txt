SFR27/2010

Background

This publication provides information about children looked after in England for the year ending 31 March 2010. The figures are based on data from the SSDA903 return collected from all local authorities. It also reports progress on seven Local Authority indicators (National Indicators under the previous government's targets).

A copy of the guidance notes for the data collection can be found at:

Methodology

Data are returned form 152 LAs in England.

National totals are derived by summing data provided by each LA and then applying rounding and suppression. The sum of each LA will not necessarily match National totals as a result.

GOR totals are derived by summing data for each LA within that region and then applying rounding and suppression.  The sum of GOR totals will not necessarily match the National total as a result.

LA level data are data as returned by each LA and have been suppressed where necessary. 

Grossing Factors: Grossing Factors have been applied to all the data in order to compensate for records with errors in their episodes. These are calculated by comparing the number of valid looked after children records reported in the return with the number of invalid records in the system. Because of the rigorous validation checks applied to data submitted, such discrepancies are usually very low and the grossing factors applied are close to 1. 

Rounding and suppression: To ensure that no individual can be identified, we use conventions for the rounding and suppression of very small numbers. National totals have been rounded to the nearest 100 if they exceed 1,000 and to the nearest 10 otherwise. Regional totals have been rounded to the nearest 10. 

For confidentiality purposes, numbers from one to five inclusive have been suppressed and replaced by a cross (x). Where any number is shown as zero (0), the original figure submitted was zero (0). It has been necessary to suppress other figures whenever it would be possible to calculate the value of a suppressed number by means of simple arithmetic. The rule applied in these circumstances has been to suppress the next smallest data item.

Data usage note: The application of grossing factors results in fractional figures. In order to allow users maximum flexibility to aggregate data to meet their own purposes, LA level data has been shown to the nearest whole number. However, it should be noted that the data is volatile and is often amended by Local Authorities. The accuracy of the data is one of the reasons the data is rounded in the SFR. As a result, the data should be used with caution.
