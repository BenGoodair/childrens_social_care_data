Children looked after in England including adoptions
2022 Reporting year

Description

This document describes the data included in the ‘Children looked after in England including adoptions: 2021 to 2022’ National Statistics release’s underlying data files. This data is released under the terms of the  Open Government License and is intended to meet at least three stars for  Open Data.

The methodology document for this subject should be referenced alongside this release. It provides information on the data sources, their coverage and quality and how the data is produced.

A guide for the 2022 data collection provides further information on the data collected.

Coverage

This data is based upon information collected in the SSDA903 (CLA) data collection. It is a child level dataset collected from local authorities in England annually. The data includes information on:

- children looked after on 31 March in each year, including unaccompanied asylum seeking children
- children looked after at any time
- children who started to be looked after
- children who ceased to be looked after
- children looked after who were adopted
- care leavers now aged 17, 18, 19, 20 and 21 years old
- children who went missing or away from placement without authorisation
- stability (of placements, schools and social workers)

 The longitudinal nature of the collection means historical information can be amended each year, so we update all time series figures published in each release.  Unless otherwise stated, numbers and percentage exclude children looked after under an agreed  series of short term placements.

Users of the data should consider the following:

- for some local authorities, for example Kent or Croydon, the figures may be impacted by large numbers of unaccompanied asylum-seeking children and their distinctive characteristics
- from April 2019 the three local authorities ‘Dorset’, ‘Bournemouth’ and ‘Poole’ reorganised into  two local authorities ‘Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole’ and ‘Dorset’. As part of this, a small number of children formerly looked after in the Christchurch area of Dorset were transferred to the new authority ‘Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole’
- from April 2021 Northamptonshire split into two local authorities, ‘North Northamptonshire’ and ‘West Northamptonshire’
- Information on children who are missing or who are away from their placement without authorisation are published as Official Statistics. Users should refer to the methodology guide when using this data and should be cautious interpreting any figures across years or between local authorities due to differing practices. Hackney did not provide any missing or away without authorisation data in 2021
- Information on the school and social worker stability of children are published as Official Statistics. Users should refer to the methodology guide when using this data.

File formats and conventions

Rounding and suppression

National and regional figures have been rounded to the nearest 10.  Local authority figures are unrounded.

Where any number is shown as zero, the original figure submitted was zero.

The following symbols have been used in the release:

- ‘c’ to protect confidentiality. Secondary suppression may have been applied
- ‘z’ for not applicable
- ‘x’ for not available
- ‘k’ used for a value that would round to zero but is not zero, for example where a percentage is <0.5%

For percentages:

- where the numerator or denominator is small then the figure is replaced by ‘c’
- they may not sum to 100% due to rounding
- they are rounded to whole numbers

Also in the release:

- the average duration for adoptions (formerly table E2) are rounded to the nearest month
- the average number of missing or away without authorisation incidents (formerly in table G1) have been rounded to one decimal place.

Footnotes:

1. Numbers have been rounded to the nearest 10. Percentages and averages rounded to the nearest whole number. Figures exclude children looked after under a series of short-term placements. Historical data may differ from older publications which is mainly due to amendments made by local authorities after the previous publication.
2. A placement may cease but the child will continue to be looked after if a new placement begins immediately. This table gives counts of placements, not children. If a child has more than one placement in the year then each will be included.
3. Analysis of revisions in previous years suggests that total numbers of placements ceasing in the latest year are often revised upwards by around 10,000 the following year as information is updated on LA systems.

1. Missing is defined as a looked after child who is not at their placement or a place they are expected to be and their whereabouts is not known.
2. Figures for 2021 exclude data for Hackney who were unable to provide figures.
3. Numbers have been rounded to the nearest 10. Percentages rounded to the nearest whole number. Figures exclude children looked after under a series of short-term placements. Historical data may differ from older publications which is mainly due to amendments made by local authorities after the previous publication.
4. Since 2017 a growing number of local authorities informed the department that they do not record incidents as 'away without authorisation' but instead report all incidents as 'missing' to maintain consistency with local police reporting. We estimate this could mean an overestimate of missing incidents of up to 8% in 2018, 10% in 2019, 13% in 2020 and 2021 and 10% in 2022; suggesting the true figures could be more like 10,700, 10,800, 11,000, 9,600 and 11,100. There is a corresponding estimate of an undercount of away without authorisation incidents of up to 18% in 2018, 22% in 2019, 29% in 2020, 32% in 2021 and 30% in 2022; suggesting the true figures could be more like 4,700, 4,700, 4,800, 3,800 and 3,600. However some of these local authorities submitted some 'away without authorisation' information and this has been included in the away from placement without authorisation table.

1. Placements relate to the total number of placements made for each looked after child during the year ending 31 March. For example, if a child has been placed in a foster placement, with parents and also in a residential care homes they will appear three times in these figures - once in each category. If a child has had 2 foster placements and 1 placement in a residential care home, they will be counted once under foster care and once under residential care. For children looked after continuously for 12 months only the placement on 31 March is counted.
2. Age at the end of the latest episode of care, or on 31 March if child is still looked after.
3. Numbers have been rounded to the nearest 10. Figures exclude children looked after under a series of short-term placements. Historical data may differ from older publications which is mainly due to amendments made by local authorities after the previous publication.

- was identified as having a substance misuse problem, and if so, if they were offered an intervention and if they refused it.
- had their annual health assessment
- had their immunisations up to date

Footnotes:

1. Average SDQ scores have been rounded to the nearest one decimal place. An SDQ score is required of all children aged 4-16 on the date of last assessment. Date of assessment is not collected so data in this table is restricted to children aged 5 to 16 years. A higher score indicates more emotional difficulties. 0-13 is considered normal, 14-16 is borderline cause for concern and 17-40 is cause for concern.
2. Figures include children who have been continuously looked after for at least 12 months on 31 March and exclude children who were looked after under an agreed series of short term placements. Numbers have been rounded to the nearest 10.  Percentages have been rounded to the nearest whole number. Age is on 31 March. Historical data may differ from older publications which is mainly due to amendments made by local authorities after the previous publication.
3. Development assessment information is collected for children aged 4 or younger on 31 March who were looked after continuously for at least 12 months.  This measures whether the child's health surveillance or health promotion checks were up to date.
4. Latest available comparable offending figures from the Ministry of Justice for all children are for 2017 where 1% of all children aged 10-17 years were convicted or subject to youth cautions, or youth conditional cautions during the year.
5. Substance misuse is defined as 'intoxication by (or regular excessive consumption and/or dependence on) psychoactive substances, leading to social, psychological, physical or legal problems'.  It includes problematic use of both legal and illegal drugs (including alcohol when used in conjunction with other substances). The term 'drug' is used to refer to any psychotropic substance, including illegal drugs, illicit use of prescription drugs and volatile substances.  Young people's drug taking is often inextricably linked with the consumption of alcohol.  Therefore the term 'substance' refers to both drugs and alcohol but not tobacco.
6. 'Had annual health assessment' records whether the child received their annual health assessment from a doctor or other suitably qualified professional during the year. Both assessments must be carried out for under fives (once in every six months before the child's fifth birthday). For fives and over a single assessment fulfils the requirement.
7. 'Teeth checked by dentist' records whether the child has had their teeth checked by a dentist in the year ending 31 March
8. Immunisations were up to date by end of March. 'Up to date' means the child has had all immunisations that a child of their age should have received, according to the immunisations timetable produced by the Department of Health.

Filename: cla_number_and_rate_per_10k_children.csv
Geographic levels: Local authority; National; Regional
Time period: 2018 to 2022
Content summary: Local authority level data for:

- Children looked after on 31 March
- Children who started to be looked after during the year
- Children who ceased to be looked after during the year

Data includes numbers of looked after children, population and rates per 10,000 children aged under 18 years. Data formerly in tables LAA1, LAC1, LAD1.

Calculated rates per 10,000 children in this release are based upon ONS population estimates. Estimates by age and LA for mid-2021 were released by ONS in November 2022 and have been used for calculating rates for 2022. Rates for earlier years in this release are based upon population estimates published in 2021 and have not yet been revised following the 2021 census. As such, rates for 2022 are not comparable to rates for earlier years. Revised population estimates by age and LA years prior to 2021 are expected to be published by ONS in early 2023.

Note: Figures for children looked after during the year can be found in the LA dataset on children who have gone missing or who are away from placement without authorisation.

For some local authorities, such as Kent or Croydon, the figures may be impacted by significant numbers of unaccompanied asylum seeking children.

Historical data may differ from older publications which is mainly due to amendments made by local authorities after the previous publication.
3. Only the first occasion on which a child started to be looked after in the year has been counted.
4. Rates per 10,000 children are calculated using the most recent mid-year population estimates from the Office for National Statistics. Estimates for 2022 year are based upon the 2021 census, however rates for earlier years have not yet been revised by ONS following the census. This means the rates per 10,000 for 2022 are not comparable to earlier years.

Historical data may differ from older publications which is mainly due to amendments made by local authorities after the previous publication.
3. Since 2017 a growing number of local authorities informed the department that they do not record incidents as 'away without authorisation' but instead report all incidents as 'missing' to maintain consistency with local police reporting. We estimate this could mean an overestimate of missing incidents of up to 8% in 2018, 10% in 2019, 13% in 2020 and 2021 and 10% in 2022; suggesting the true figures could be more like 10,700, 10,800, 11,000, 9,600 and 11,100. There is a corresponding estimate of an undercount of away without authorisation incidents of up to 18% in 2018, 22% in 2019, 29% in 2020, 32% in 2021 and 30% in 2022; suggesting the true figures could be more like 4,700, 4,700, 4,800, 3,800 and 3,600. However some of these local authorities submitted some 'away without authorisation' information and this has been included in the away from placement without authorisation table.
4. Away from placement without authorisation is defined as a looked after child whose whereabouts is known but who is not at their placement or place they are expected to be and the carer has concerns or the incident has been notified to the local authority or the police.

5. 'Mid-year moves' is the number of times a child moves school (or from no school to a school) between 1 April and 31 March, excluding the period 1 August to 30 September, and excluding any moves prior to the date on which the child first entered care during the year.
6. Excludes expected transitions from one school phase to another, for example primary school to secondary school at age 11.
7. EHC plans also includes statements of SEN. Statements were phased out from 2014 to 2018.
8. The summer census in 2020 was not carried out due to the coronavirus pandemic. Therefore it has not been possible to produce data for 2020, and 2021 data excludes children aged 15 at the beginning of the 2019/20 academic year.
9. UASC are generally older - care should be taken when interpreting the data for these children.
