Outcomes for Children Looked After by Local Authorities in England, 31 March 2016
SFR12/2017

Overview

This publication provides information about the outcomes of children looked after in England for the year ending 31 March 2016.  The figures are based on data from the SSDA903 return collected from all local authorities and matched to attainment data, school census data and alternative provision census data in the national pupil database (NPD).  A copy of the guidance notes for the SSDA903 data collection can be found here.  “Looked after children” in this document is used to mean children who have been looked after continuously for at least 12 months at 31 March.

The underlying data covers the national tables, not including children in need. 

We used the following rounding and suppression methodology in the tables:

National and regional figures have been rounded to the nearest 10 and Local Authority figures have been rounded to the nearest 5. For confidentiality purposes, numbers from one to five inclusive have been replaced in the published tables by a cross (x). To ensure the suppressed number cannot be identified by simple arithmetic secondary suppression may be required. In this case the next smallest number is also suppressed.

Percentages have been rounded to whole numbers for key stage 1 and key stage 2 and rounded to one decimal place for key stage 4. Exclusions have been rounded to two decimal places. Averages have been rounded to one decimal place at key stage 2 and at key stage 4 for attainment and to two decimal places at key stage 4 for progress. This is in line with the department’s rounding protocols for the main attainment releases. Where the numerator in a percentage was five or less or the denominator was 1 to 10, the percentages has been suppressed and replaced by a cross (x). Not all percentages will sum to 100 due to these rounding conventions. Averages that are based on 1 to 5 have been suppressed and replaced by a cross (x).

In addition, the following convention has been used:

‘.’ means not applicable

‘..’ means not available

‘-‘ means negligible – used to represent a percentage that would appear as 0 when rounded but is not zero

We did not round the underlying data but used additional suppressions as necessary to reduce the risk of disclosure.
