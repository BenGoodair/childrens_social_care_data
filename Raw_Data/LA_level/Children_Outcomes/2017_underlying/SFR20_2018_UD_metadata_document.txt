Outcomes for Children Looked After by Local Authorities in England, 31 March 2017
SFR20/2018

Overview

SFR20/2018 provides information about the outcomes of children looked after by local authorities in England for the year ending 31 March 2017. LA level data is published for the local authority that looks after the child. The figures are based on data from the SSDA903 return collected from local authorities, and matched to attainment data, school census data and alternative provision census data. This document describes the underlying data. The term “looked after children” in this document is used to mean children who have been looked after continuously for at least 12 months at 31 March 2017.

The underlying data contains the local authority data underlying the national data in the tables, for 2017, for looked after children only. We published these data in local authority tables, for 2016 and earlier years.

The underlying data has been rounded and suppressed where necessary  to reduce the risk of disclosure of information about individual children.

Underlying Data Files

There are five underlying data files:

SFR20_2018_Table2_KS2_UD: Tables 2a and 2b: Key stage 2 eligibility,  performance and progress of looked after children, 2017

SFR20_2018_Table3_KS4_UD: Tables 3a, 3b, 3c: Key stage 4 eligibility,  performance and progress of looked after children, 2017

SFR20_2018_Table4_SEN_UD: Table 4a: Looked after children by special educational need (SEN), 2017

SFR20_2018_Table5_Abs_UD: Table 5: Absence for looked after children, 2017

SFR20_2018_Table6_Excl_UD: Table 6: Exclusions for looked after children, 2016 (The latest available data for exclusions is for 2016.)

Note that there is no underlying data for key stage 1 due to the small numbers of children which results in a large amount of suppression.

They contain national and regional data as well as local authority data.  The national and regional data is rounded in the same way as the data in the national tables. The local authority data is not rounded.  Where necessary, the local authority data has been suppressed to reduce the risk of disclosure of information about individual children. 

All of the underlying data files are in CSV format.

National and regional data on the number of children has been rounded to the nearest ten. Rounding on percentages and averages is to the same number of decimal places as in the national tables in the main statistical first release, for each measure. 

Local authority data has been suppressed as necessary using the following rules:

(Zero denominators)

Where the number of eligible children is zero this is displayed as zero. Any corresponding numerators, percentages, sums or averages are replaced with a dot (.) to indicate that they are not applicable. 
	
(Small denominators, not including zeroes)

Where the number of eligible children is between one and five the denominator is suppressed with a cross (x). 

(Small numerators, including zeros)

Where the numerator is five or fewer (including zero), it is suppressed with a cross (x). 

(Percentages)

Where the number of eligible children is between one and ten, or the corresponding numerator is five or fewer (including zero), the percentage is suppressed with a cross (x). 

(Averages)

Where the number of eligible children is between one and five, the sum and average is suppressed with a cross (x). 

There are some additional suppressions, where we have deemed this necessary to reduce the risk of disclosure of information about individual children.

The first five column names and descriptions are as follows: 

LA_order
This enables sorting in order of England, region, and local authority within region
New_geog_code	
New geography code
geog_l

Local authority key stage 2 attainment data has been updated to align with the  national main key stage 2 release. The national level data remains the same as in previous years and excludes pupils with missing or lost test results and pupils where results are suppressed pending the outcome of a maladministration investigation. The local authority level data excludes pupils with lost results but includes those with missing results or pending maladministration. It also excludes children that have recently arrived from overseas. As a result, national level England figures don’t match national figures from local authority data.

Note that the confidence intervals for the average Progress 8 scores can be derived using the same formulae as used in the national main key stage 4  release (as well as the national tables of this release).

Local authority key stage 4 attainment data has been updated to align with the national main key stage 4 release. The local authority attainment data has children recently arrived from overseas removed. As a result, national level England figures don’t match national figures from local authority data.
