1. Children looked after continuously for at least 12 months as at 31 March excluding those children in respite care.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"2. Immunisations were up to date by the end of 31 March 2014. 'Up to date' means that by 31 March the child has had all the immunisations that a child of their age should have received, according to the immunisations timetable reproduced by the Department of Health which is available via the following link: http://www.nhs.uk/Planners/vaccinations/Pages/Vaccinationchecklist.aspx",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3. Records whether the child had their teeth checked by a dentist during the year ending 31 March 2014.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"4. Records whether the child received their annual health assessment from a doctor or other suitably qualified professional during the year ending 31 March 2014. Health Assessments must be carried out twice a year for those under 5 years of age. Both these assessments must be carried out in order for the Annual Assessment requirement to be satisfied for under 5s. The assessment should be carried out once in every period of six months before the child's fifth birthday. This means that one assessment should be carried out in the first six months and one in the second six months. For those aged 5 or over, a single annual assessment fulfils the requirement.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"5. Development assessment data is collected for children aged 5 or younger at 31 March who were looked after continuously for at least 12 months, excluding children in respite care. This measures whether the child’s Health Surveillance or Health Promotion Checks were up-to-date.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Please note, for a minority of local authorities there has been some under-reporting of the number of children up to date with these health measures. This mostly affects immunisations, teeth checks and development assessments for under 5's.  This issue was only identified after the collection had closed and therefore local authorities will not be able to amend data until the next collection.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"All numbers relating to national or regional totals have been rounded to the nearest 10, all Local Authority numbers have been rounded to the nearest 5.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
x = number less than or equal to 5 or percentage where the numerator is less than or equal to 5 or the denominator is less than or equal to 10.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
. = not applicable,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
See technical notes 19 and 20 for more information on rounding conventions.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
