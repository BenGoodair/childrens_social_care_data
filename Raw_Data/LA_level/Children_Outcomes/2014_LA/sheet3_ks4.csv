,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1. Children looked after continuously for at least 12 months as at 31 March excluding those children in respite care. Only children who are matched to key stage 4 data are included.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2. Figures for 2014 are based on provisional data.  Figures for all other years are based on final data.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3. The ‘2013 methodology’ data removes the rules regarding the Wolf Review recommendations and early entry policy from the calculation of performance measures (see note 4 below),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"4. New 2014 methodology applied to 2013/14 data. Two major reforms have been implemented which affect the calculation of key stage 4 (KS4) performance measures data. Professor Alison Wolf’s Review of Vocational Education recommendations which restrict the qualifications counted, prevent any qualification from counting as larger than one GCSE and cap the number of non-GCSEs included in performance measures at two per pupil. There is also an early entry policy to only count a pupil’s first attempt at a qualification. More details can be found in the statistical release: https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/provisional-gcse-and-equivalent-results-in-england-2013-to-2014",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5. This is the percentage of children looked after continuously for 12 months at 31 March aged 15 at the start of the academic year who had a valid Unique Pupil Number (UPN) recorded in the SSDA903 return.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"6. This is the number of looked after children at the end of key stage 4 in all educational settings. If a child is recorded as at the end of key stage 4 (in year group 11) more than once, then the same child may appear in the local authority results in more than one year. This affects around 3% of looked after children each year.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"7. From 2009/2010 until 2012/2013 IGCSEs, accredited at time of publication, have been counted as GCSE equivalents and also as English & mathematics GCSEs. From 2013/14 a number of these qualifications are now regulated as Level 1/2 Certificates and are counted in the same way as a GCSE in this publication. More details can be found in the statistical release: https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/provisional-gcse-and-equivalent-results-in-england-2013-to-2014",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
