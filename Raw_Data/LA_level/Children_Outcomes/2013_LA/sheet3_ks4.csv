1. Children looked after continuously for at least 12 months as at 31 March excluding those children in respite care. Only children who are matched to key stage 4 data are included.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2. Figures for 2013 are based on provisional data.  Figures for all other years are based on final data.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3. This is the percentage of children looked after continuously for 12 months at 31 March aged 15 at the start of the academic year who had a valid Unique Pupil Number (UPN) recorded in the SSDA903 return.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"4. This is the number of looked after children at the end of key stage 4 in all educational settings. If a child is recorded as at the end of key stage 4 (in year group 11) more than once, then the same child may appear in the local authority results in more than one year. This affects around 3% of looked after children each year.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5. From 2010 iGCSEs have been counted as GCSE equivalents and also as English & mathematics GCSEs,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Figures for previous years may be different to previously published figures as LAs may update information,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
National and Regional figures have been rounded to the nearest 10. Local Authority figures have been rounded to the nearest 5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
