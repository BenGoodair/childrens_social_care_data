1.  Children looked after continuously for at least 12 months as at 31 March 2015 and aged 5 to 16. Excludes children in respite care.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2. England and regional totals have been rounded to the nearest 10.  Other numbers have been rounded to the nearest 5.  Percentages have been rounded to the nearest whole number. Average SDQ scores have been rounded to one decimal place. See methodology and quality document for more information on rounding.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3. Number of children looked after continuously for at least 12 months and aged 5 to 16 for whom an SDQ score was received via the looked after children return (SSDA903).  An SDQ score is required of all children aged 4-16 on the date of the last assessment. The date of assessment is not collected on the looked after children return and therefore this,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
     cohort has been restricted to age 5-16 as at 31 March.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4. Average scores have been derived from unrounded numerator and denominator values.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
