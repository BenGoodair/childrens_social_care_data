Outcomes for Children Looked After by Local Authorities in England, as at 31 March 2015
SFR11/2016

Overview

This publication provides information about the outcomes of children looked after in England for the year ending 31 March 2015.  The figures are based on data from the SSDA903 return collected from all Local Authorities (LA), and from attainment data and School Census data from the National Pupil Database (NPD).  A copy of the guidance notes for the SSDA903 data collection can be found here.  “Looked after children” in this document is used to mean children who have been looked after continuously for at least 12 months at 31 March.

LA level data have been suppressed where necessary.  To ensure that no individual can be identified, conventions have been used to suppress very small numbers.  Numbers from one to five inclusive have been suppressed and replaced by a cross (x).  Where any number is shown as zero (0), the original figure submitted was zero (0).

Regional totals are derived by summing data for each LA within that region and then applying rounding and suppression.  Each region has been rounded to the nearest 10 children.  This is to prevent the calculation of the numbers of children for LAs that have been suppressed.  The sum of regional totals will not necessarily match the national total as a result.

National totals are derived by summing data provided by each LA and then applying rounding and suppression.  The sum of each LA will not necessarily match national totals as a result.

Where data is not available for a given year or age group, this is represented by a dot (.).
